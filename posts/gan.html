          <h1>A Short story on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</h1>
          <p class="meta">Author: Bibek Ray &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; Date: 21st August 2024</p>
          <p><a href="http://Meta.ai">Meta.ai</a> recently launched their latest model Llama 3.1, which can generate realistic images for free!<br/>
            It was fascinating to see how realistic the images it was able to create, which made me ponder upon the question, <em>"How does image generation work?"</em><br/>
            So I decided to spend a few hours learning some of the very basics of image generation. During my exploration, I stumbled upon <strong>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</strong>, a key concept in generative AI. To make it simpler and more fun to understand, I came up with an analogy involving two friends, Garry and Danny. Let me share it with you!</p>
          <p><strong>The Tale of Garry and Danny: Understanding GANs:</strong><br/>
            <strong>Meet the friends:</strong>
            <em>Garry (Generator):</em><br/>
            <ul>
                <li>Garry is the storyteller. His job is to create stories (images) that sound real.</li>
                <li>Initially, Garry’s stories are terrible and obviously fake.</li>
            </ul>
            <em>Danny (Discriminator):</em><br/>
            <ul>
                <li>Danny is the critic. His job is to identify which stories (images) are real and which are fake.</li>
                <li>Initially, Danny is bad at distinguishing fake stories from real ones.</li>
            </ul>
            <em>The Storybook (Image Dataset):</em><br/>
            <ul>
                <li>The stories (images) that Danny uses to learn are based on a storybook filled with true stories (real images).</li>
                <li>This storybook helps Danny recognize the details that make a story real.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <em>The Debate:</em><br/>
            <p>Initially, both the dumb friends start debating, with,<br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>Garry telling a fake story, and Danny trying to catch it.</li>
                    <li>Through feedback and improvement, Garry makes his stories more believable, and Danny becomes better at spotting fakes.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Outcome:</strong><br/>
                After many rounds of this back-and-forth, Garry becomes a master storyteller, and Danny becomes an expert critic.<br/>
                <strong>Summary:</strong><br/>
                Both start off as novices but improve each other through constant interaction.<br/>
                By the end, Garry can create highly realistic stories (images), and Danny can accurately identify real and fake stories (images).<br/>
