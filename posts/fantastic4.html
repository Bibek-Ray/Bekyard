        <h2>Fantastic 4 - Is Marvel actually cooking something?</h2>
        <p>With the post credit scene(2nd one, not the first one) of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbolts*"><em class="thunderbolts">Thunderbolts*</em></a> we get a clear indication of what Marvel is planning with it's upcoming movies - especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers:_Doomsday"><em class="avengers-doomsday">Avengers: Doomsday</em></a></p>
        <hr>
        <p>First of all, Thunderbolts* was a good movie as compared to Marvel's last few projects and the movie exceeded my expectations.<br/>
        Sentry was a great character. I had not much idea of him, as I had myself seen the character for the first time in the Mobile Game - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Contest_of_Champions" style="color: #baa908;">Marvel's Contest of Champions</a>.
        But damn, he was powerful. Guess we can see him as a formidable opponent to Doctor Doom.....or an ally to him? No wonder everyone's excited.</p>
        <p>The post-credit scene also showed that the Fantastic 4 were arriving to the Sacred Timeline, that is, Earth-616, Marvel's main timeline. That pretty much explains that their earth might have been destroyed by Galactus or is it something else?</p>
        <p>Well, I say so because I have a theory. What if they belonged to some different universe and, for some reason got ended up in this universe which is based on the 60s?</p>
        <p>As per the MCU, if a superhero from one universe starts residing in another universe, then eventually an incursion happens, where both the universe - the one where they belong and the one where the reside collide with each other destroying both the universes.
           If that happens, then they are bound to leave the universe, and along with them Victor will also leave that Universe, giving him all the valid reasons to plan something bigger... something he can call his own - his own Battleworld.</p>
